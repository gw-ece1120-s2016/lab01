# Introduction
Assigned: 2016-01-11

Due: 2016-01-18

This is the Lab 1 assignment for ECE 1120 - C Programming for ECE.

The goals of this lab are to introduce you to the Cloud9 development
environment, and the GitHub software hosting repository and use these
tools to build and run a simple C program.

# Steps

## Create a free GitHub account
GitHub is Web-based source code repository service. That is, it lets
users easily store and share source code - the ingredients that are
used to build software.

To create an account, visit https://github.com. Use the same username
that's associated with your GW email account. For example, if your
GW email is randomstudent@gwu.edu, use the username "randomstudent".

## Create a free Cloud9 account
Cloud9 is a web-based integrated development environment and Linux
workspace. This lets you have your very own Linux system that you can
use to edit, build, run, and test your software.

Once you have a GitHub account created, you can use that same account
to sign up for a Cloud9 account. First, visit https://c9.io then click
on the icon that lets you sign in with GitHub. Once you have logged in
with your account, create a *PRIVATE* workspace called "work".

## Clone your submission repository

This step must be done after TA created said repo. So, make sure you call your TA and let him know about your github account.

In the main directory of your c9 home run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gw-ece1120-s2016/your_github_id_assignment
```

This command should create a folder named your_github_id_submissions. Change to that directory using cd command, for example:

```
$ cd engin_assignment
```

We will manage your homework submissions using git. All the lab assignments must be inside this folder for the rest of the semester. 

## Use git to clone the Lab 1 assignment.

***Make sure you are inside your assignments folder.***

From the cloud9 command-line, use the git source code control tool to
make a copy of the starter source code for this assignment.

```
randomstudent@work:~/workspace $ git clone https://github.com/gw-ece1120-s2016/lab01
```

You should see some output similar to this:
```
Cloning into 'lab01'...
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

#### Do some house keeping before proceeding

Remove .git folder from the assignment:

```
$ rm -rf lab01/.git
```

Make sure git tracks your progress on the assignment:

```
$ git add lab01/*
```

These steps are crucial for correct submission. We are not responsible for worng submissions, therefore please feel free to ask TA for clarification or confirmation.

## Build the starter program for the lab 1 assignment

Go into the cloned lab01 directory (i.e. folder):

```
cd lab01
```

Build your first program from the source code by running "make":

```
randomstudent@work:~/workspace $ make
```

You should see some output similar to this:
```
cc -Wall    hello.c   -o hello
```

Finally run your first C program:
```
randomstudent@work:~/workspace $ ./hello
Hello world!
```

## Edit the lab 1 assignment to print your name.
From the Cloud9 workspace menu on the left, navigate to hello.c source
file. First, modify the comment to have your own name. Next, figure
out how to add another print statement to your program so that it
prints your name when it runs (on its own line), for example:

```
Hello world!
written by Random A. Student

```

## Edit the program to compute a simple math problem.

After your program prints your name, you'll write some code to compute
some simple math problems.

Add the following to your code (punctuation is very important):
```
/* This section computes a sum. */
int x, y, z;
x = 10;
y = 20;
z = x + y;
printf("x is %d, y is %d, and z is %d\n", x, y, z);
```

This code tells the computer to create three variables to hold
integers. Then it sets the value of two of them to 10 and 20, and
computes their sum and puts it into the third variable.

Finally, it prints out all three of them.

## Add another simple math problem to your program.

Now modify your program so it solves another math problem (without
deleting anything in the previous sections). Create three variables to
represent the height, width, and depth of a box. Write an expression
to compute the volume of the box and print out the height, width,
depth, and volume. Assume the height is 11, the depth is 14, and the
width is 7. Add a comment to describe what this section of your
code is doing.

## Submission procedure

You have to "commit" changes you made in the assignment. In order to do that run:

```
$ git commit -am "Write some submission message here"
```

This will only update your local repository, meaning that nothing will be updated on github. You have to "push" your changes in order to do that:

```
$ git push origin master
```

Make sure you didn't receive any errors in the output.

You can check the organization page on github for correct submission. Go to your own assignments repo, and make sure all the files are updated with the changes you made.
